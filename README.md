# IKDU Medialogy Poster

![Physical poster design](Assets/PosterStills/01.jpg)

 [A interactive physical poster design for my IKDU course at Aalborg University fall 2024](https://cileene.github.io/IKDU_Medialogy_Poster/)

 The poster is designed to be printed in A0 format. Scanning the QR code on the physical poster takes you to the webbuild of this project.

 NB: The physics sim is non-deterministic... So if the last composition looks off, well just try again! (bug/feature??)
